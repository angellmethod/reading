# Plan for the Unit 

This unit introduces the core concepts of classical hypothesis testing. It builds on the knowledge that you built about sampling theory and random varaibles to ask (and answer) questions of the following form. 

- Suppose you have observed a difference in sample averages between two groups of a certain magnitude, _d_. How likely is it to see a difference of this size or larger, if in fact the two groups have the same expected value?

# Plan for the Unit 

This unit introduces the core concepts of classical hypothesis testing. It builds on the knowledge that you built about sampling theory and random varaibles to ask (and answer) questions of the following form. 

- Suppose you have observed a difference in sample averages between two groups of a certain magnitude, _d_. How likely is it to see a difference of this size or larger, if in fact the two groups have the same expected value?  

- **Pairings of data**:  When data has a logical pairing structure, it is possible to use this information to conduct a t-test that is uniformly better powered than without this pairing data. As a result, the deliberate data scientists can either detect smaller effects for the same budget, or can realize (potentially considerable) reductions in cost. 
- **Non-Metric data**: When data does not contain metric information—that is, it is not interval or ratio data—there the t-tests that have been covered to this point are of no use. However, with the hypothesis-testing framework, it is possible to identify some *other* statistic that has a known distribution that works with lower-information data. In particular, this week will focus on (a) the sign-rank; and (b) the rank-sum tests.

# Unit 10: Part 2 

## Capturing Nonlinear Relationships 

Although the statistical models that you are bulding are a linear combination of terms, it does not mean that the outcome values only exist on a plane. 

In this section, which we anticipate will take about **30** minutes to complete the reading, note taking, and attending lecture, you will learn about how to build additional complexity into the models that you build by transforming and shaping input data.

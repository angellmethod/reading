# Optional: Covariance and Correlation Coding 

This is **optional** but if you would like to put this work to use right now, you can head to the [UCB Datahub](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user/redirect/rstudio/) and put this question of covariance and correlation into practice with a 10 minute coding activity. 

On the Datahub, navigate to `./week_03/` and work through the optional coding activity.

# Plan for Unit 8 

This unit continues the work of classical hypothesis testing. It builds on the work of the previous unit by asking questions about data that has *more unique* qualities than were covered in the previous unit. These unique qualities include: 

- **Pairings of data**:  When data has a logical pairing structure, it is possible to use this information to conduct a t-test that is uniformly better powered than without this pairing data. As a result, the deliberate data scientists can either detect smaller effects for the same budget, or can realize (potentially considerable) reductions in cost. 
- **Non-Metric data**: When data does not contain metric information—that is, it is not interval or ratio data—there the t-tests that have been covered to this point are of no use. However, with the hypothesis-testing framework, it is possible to identify some *other* statistic that has a known distribution that works with lower-information data. In particular, this week will focus on (a) the sign-rank; and (b) the rank-sum tests.

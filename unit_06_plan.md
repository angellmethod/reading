# Plan for Unit 6

In this unit you will learn about a parameter estimation strategy called *maximum likelihood*. This strategy writes down a function in terms of data and weights for that data, defines a target function—the *likelihood score*—and then works to iteratively choose values for the weights that literally maximize the likelihood of observing the data.

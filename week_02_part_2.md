# Week 2: Part 2 

In Part 2 of this week's work, which we anticipate will take you **90** minutes to read, take notes, and attend lecture, you will learn about probability distribution functions applied to more than one varaibles at a time. 

With this understanding, you will be able to make statements about one variable, given information about another variable.

# Unit 6: Part 1 

In the first part of this week, which we anticipate will take you **45** minutes to complete, you will learn about the logic and meaning of hypothesis tests as decision rules.

This will cover the general appraoch to Frequentist Hypothesis testing, the components of a hypothesis test, and a one-tailed and two-tailed z-test.

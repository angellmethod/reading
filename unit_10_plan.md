# Plan for Unit 10

## Descriptive Model Building 

In this week's work, you will learn about practical considerations when building linear models. 

In the first part of the week you will learn about the different reasons that you might build a statistical model: 

1. to **describe** features of the world;
2. to **predict** features of the world; and, 
3. to **explain** features of the world. 

We're aware that you have also used this language in introduction to research design. In this work, we will bring this to bear on statistical model building. 

In the second part of the week, you will learn about expanding the linear model to capture nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. 

In the third part of the week, you will learn about using categorical data as a predictor in a statistical model, and finally in the fourth part of the week you will learn about estimating relationships that change based on other variables.

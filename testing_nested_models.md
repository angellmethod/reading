# Reading: Testing Nested Models 

Please read [this section](./docs/f_test_PSU_stat_501_notes.pdf) on using the F-test to test nested models. 

In tests of this form: 

- The *intercept-only* model is the "null" model. 
- The *fuller* model that you have estimated is the "alternative" model. 

The test is whether the F-statistic that this change in parameters creates is larger than the change that we would expect under the null hypothesis that in the population there is no *actual* relationship between outcomes and those variables. That is, that $\beta_{1} = \dots = \beta_{k} = 0$.

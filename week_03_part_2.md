# Week 3: Part 2 

In part 2 of this week's work, which we anticipate will require about **90** minutes to read, take notes, and attend lecture, you will learn about conditional expectation as an *operator* and then the *conditional expectation function*. Sometimes these concepts can be a little difficult to keep straight -- as we will use them in this class: 

- Operators map random varaibles (which are functions) onto a real number -- the input might be a series of numbers or a function, **but** the output is a single number
- Functions map inputs onto output -- the input might be a serires of numbers or a function, **and** the output has the same shape or structure as the input

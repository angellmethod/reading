# Weak Law of Large Numbers 

Please continue to read section 3.2.1, picking up where you left off, in *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*. 

- Convergence in probability and the continuous mapping theorem are results that are very useful to prove the key insight from this section, the *Weak Law of Large Numbers*. 
- The *Weak Law of Large Numbers* is the first asymptotic property that we deal with in this course, and provides guarantees of samples with only *very weak* requirements made of the data.

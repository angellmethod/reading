# Unit 6: Part 3 

In the third and final part of this week, which we anticipate will take about **60** minutes to complete, you will learn about concepts that are important the the *practice* of conducting t-tests. This includes the idea of computing a confidence interval for a parameter estimate, placing the results of a test into *practical* context, and how to avoid seeking out results that might *appear* to be significant, but that instead are just apparitions that arise from p-hacking exercises.

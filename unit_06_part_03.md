# Unit 7: Part 3 

In the third and final part of this week, which we anticipate will take about **45** minutes to complete, you will place the results of a t-test into context. 

 To do so, you will learn about statistical power and interpreting the *practical* meaning of a result. 

 At the end of this section, you will be able to reason and communicate about whether a statistically significant result is practically important; and also what practical information a statistically *in*significant result might provide.

# Plan for Unit 11 

In this unit you will learn how to reason about, and answer questions where you want to take action that has effects. This topic -- which generally referred to as *causality* -- can sometimes feel like an academic pursuit, but we contend that a very large proportion of business questions are actually causal in nature. 

You will start by learning about these causal questions and a helpful conceptual tool referred to as a causal graph. In the second part of this unit you will learn that under some circumstances it is possible to estimate the same models as the previous units, but that the results of these models have a causal interpretation. In the third part of this unit, you will assess whether the data and model that you are using does, in fact, hold a causal interpretation or if instead it might be a biased estimator.

# Unit 1: Part 2

## Set Theory Probability 

In this section, which we estimate might take you **90** to read, take notes, and attend lectures, you will learn about how real-world occurrences can be mapped onto the axioms that we have built with set theory. 

You will then learn several fundamental components of probability theory -- joint, conditional and marginal probability -- and then how to build these into the concept of statistical independence.

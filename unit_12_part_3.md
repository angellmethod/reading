# Unit 12: Part 3 
## Evaluating Whether Data Meets the CLM Requirements 

In this section, which we anticipate might take you **60** minutes to complete, you will learn about how to test whether your data and model together meet the requirements of the *CLM* to produce reliable estimates. 

For each of the CLM assumptions, you will learn about how to test whether the data satisfies the assumption. 

We would like to say right from the start: 

1. Each of the tests we conduct are variants of a statistical hypothesis test. By this we mean, each test produces a test statistic that has a known distribution under the null hypothesis. 
2. We should be quite careful about what we conclude if we *fail to reject the null hypothesis.* None of the tests in this section produce dispositive evidence that our data and model are "good to go!" for use under the CLM. 

Instead, the null hypothesis for each test is, "The data meets the assumption." This is **not** a strong position to argue from, because there are many ways to fail to reject a null hypothesis without the null hypothesis, in fact, being true.

# Foundations of Agnostic Statistics

The interested student may want to read section 3.3 and 3.3.1 in *Foundations of Agnostic Statistics*. 

These sections present a more complete treatment of the plug-in principle that you have just attended a lecture about. However, we think that a student pressed for time, can safely continue with the working knowledge from the lecture. 

- Pages 116â€”120
- Sections titled **The Plug-In Principle** and **The Usual Plug-In Regularity Conditions**

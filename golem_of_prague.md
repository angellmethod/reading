# Reading: Statistical Rethinking

Read the apocryphal story of the [Golem of Prague](https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fuclibs.org%2FPID%2F424397) 
from Richard McElreath's **very** good *Statistical Rethinking*. 

(The link will take you to a UCB login for online access to the book.) 

Please read: 

- Section 1: The Golem of Prague 
- Section 1.1: Statistical Golems 

You can read on from there if you like (the text is really engaging) about McElreath's ideas for how to *rethink* statistical tests (this begins in section 1.2), or you can stop after section 1.1.

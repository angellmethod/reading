# Unit 3: Summarizing Distributions and Relationships

In this unit you will learn about how to *summarize* a single variable and the relationship between two variables. 

Here the idea behind summarizing variables: the probability distribution/density function may be unknown. Or, if the probability function is known, it may be so complex that it is hard to work with. 

When we summarize a variable or a relationship between variables we attempt to report useful, but less, information about a random variable. 

There are two sections of study in this unit that are approximately evenly balanced in their workload.

# Cheat Sheet: One Sample t-Test



Assumptions:

1. Metric scale.  
  - In particular, the t-test is not valid for variables which only have an ordinal structure.
2. IID data.
3. No major deviations from normality, considering the sample size.
  - In particular, the t-test is invalid for highly skewed distributions when sample size is larger than 30.  It may also be invalid for very highly skewed distributions at higher sample sizes.
